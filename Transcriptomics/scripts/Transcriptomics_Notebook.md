### Entry 1: 2023-10-16.

-   Transcriptomics Day 3.

-   Goals for the day:

    -   Review the quality of our Illumina data from our google sheet.
    -   Assess our previously assembled de novo transcriptome assembly using scripts provided through Trinity.
    -   Map reads and quantify abundance simultaneously using Salmon.
    -   Prepare data for import into DESeq2.
    -   Start analyzing the gene expression data using DESeq2

### Entry 2: 2023-10-18.

-   Transcriptomics Day 4.

-   Goals for the day:

    -   Assemble the quant.sf files generated by salmon into a matrix to import into DESeq2.
    -   Start analyzing the gene expression data using DESeq2

<div id='id-section3'/>

### Entry 3: 2023-10-23.

-   Transcriptomics Day 5.

-   Goals for the day:

    -   Review results from filtering of the de novo assembly and transfer the new gene expression matrix.
    -   Explore patterns in the gene expression data using DESeq2: explore data, plot PCA, test for DGE, make a Venn diagram.

-   see `transcriptomics_day4.R` file for scripts from class (added on from day 4)

### Entry 4: 2023-10-25

-   Transcriptomics day 6

-   We downloaded many R packages. We did a weighted gene correlation network analysis to look for clusters across transcripts. These transcripts are defined as "modules".

-   worked with `transcriptomics_day6.R` script.

-   Goals for today:

    -   Transfer a data file that includes additional trait information.

    -   Work step by step through correlation (or association) analyses using WGCNA: install packages, import and filter the data, look for outliers, normalize, construct networks, explore module eigengenes, associate module eigengenes with traits, and visualize the data along the way!

### Entry 5: 2023-10-30

-   Transcriptomics Day 7

-   review whale cancer paper.

-   Goals for today:

    -   Discuss "what's missing" in hands-on coding sessions - to better set you up for the future (so you're not surprised)

    -   Continue working through the correlation (or association) analyses using WGCNA (weighted gene co-expression network analysis): associate module eigengenes with traits and visualize the data!
    
    -   Perform Gene Ontology (GO) functional enrichment analyses using GOMWU with our DESeq2 results.

What's missing in our in-class coding sessions...

-   Choosing which programs to use, installing the programs for use, troubleshooting code, moving from one file type to the next, exploring parameter space. ChatGPT and Google and people can be helpful!
