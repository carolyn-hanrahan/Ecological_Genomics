### Entry 1: 2023-09-11.

-   We reviewed the red spruce study system and exome cature data
-   We discussed the structure of the fastqc files (DNA sequence plus Qscores)
-   Using the program FastQC

### Entry 2: 2023-09-13.

-   After discussing the FastQC results, we saw good quality sequence data for most of the read length.
-   The initial 5 bp or so had more variable base frequencies, and the very end of the readshad slightly lower Q-scores.
-   Based on this, we set up an analysis to trim the reads using the fastp program.
-   We ran the bash script `fastp.sh` for this.
-   We looked at the html files produced by `fastp`

### Entry 3: 2023-09-18.

-   We set up this lab notebook
-   We ran the mapping.sh file over the weekend for our red spruce populations.
-   Visualize sequence alignment files (\*.sam) from our mapping
-   Process the files to binary and started running `bam_stats.sh` as well as `process_bam.sh`
-   Talked to Nicole about paper selection for class

### Entry 4: 2023-09-20

-   We finished processing `bam_stats.sh` by altering the vim file and running `bash bam_stats.sh`. Following this, we examined the read data by using the head command.
-   Created an ANGSD directory and a script for running the ANGSD program to determine genotype likelihood.
-   Began running this script using `tmux` in the background.

### Entry 5: 2023-09-25

- Today's learning objectives: 
  - Calculate diversity stats for our focal pops (SFS, theta-W, theta-Pi, Tajimaâ€™s D)
  - Summarize the results in R and share to google doc
  - Introduce Fst in ANGSD using genotype probabilities

### Entry 6: 2023-09-27

- Today's learning objectives: 
  - Review the diversity stats for our focal pops on the google doc
  - Estimate genetic differentiation (Fst) in ANGSD between our focal red spruce pops and black spruce
  - Visualize population structure using PCA and Admixture
