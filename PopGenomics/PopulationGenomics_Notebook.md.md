### Entry 1: 2023-09-11.
- We reviewed the red spruce study system and exome cature data 
- We discussed the structure of the fastqc files (DNA sequence plus Qscores)
- Using the program FastQC

### Entry 2: 2023-09-13. 
- After discussing the FastQC results, we saw good quality sequence data for most of the read length. 
- The initial 5 bp or so had more variable base frequencies, and the very end of the readshad slightly lower Q-scores. 
- Based on this, we set up an analysis to trim the reads using the fastp program. 
- We ran the bash script `fastp.sh` for this. 
- We looked at the html files produced by `fastp`
